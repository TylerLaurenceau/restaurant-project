#What the client wanted for the site
* We currently do not have a logo. We are not looking for anything fancy but would like it to look professional. This can be just some plain stylized text or you could use The Noun Project to pull an icon out of to add a little extra to the page.
* We currently have a Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram Account and are registered at Open Table. Please include icons for all of those. Don’t worry about the links to our pages, we can fill those in later.
* This image should be picture of the inside of our restaurant. You should be able to find a nice one on Flickr’s website. Make sure you have an appropriate license to use it.
* This is our latest news. This will be pulled in from an API that we will provide for you. Keep in mind this will change frequently so make sure to account for spacing.
* We change our our specials each day. Again this will come from an API and will change daily. The API only includes the name, description and price so you will need to grab a generic image from Flickr.
* This should be a Google Map and include our address from above.
Our menu is broken up into three categories. Since we only serve dinner that is all you need to worry about but you'll need to pull in appetizers, main courses and a la cart items individually. Again, this can all be pulled from our API.
We would like more food photos to show up as well. Again you can pull from Flickr.

#About the restaurant
* Think you know fine dining? Think again. Located in the historic M. Rich Building in the heart of Downtown Atlanta, 
“South-Bound” has been named ‘Most Innovative Restaurant’ inside the Perimeter for 2017. From the moment you step inside our restaurant, you will notice that we strive to bring you the best possible dining experience in Atlanta. Our space features a tap wall that, for some, just might be considered the 8th wonder of the world. Beer is available everywhere from Germany to Ireland to local Georgia brews, plus our world-famous beers, brewed in-house. The extensive tap wall, which often gets mistaken as decoration, boasts over 60 beers on draft. Top shelf liquor and wine is also available for the beer challenged. We pride ourselves in our menu that goes far beyond the expected. Food selections combine unique fine dining with traditional southern foods. It all started with a dream of two old friends, to bring together the best food in the Southeast region and the love of great conversation and friends. Tyler Laurenceau is a Georgia native who oversees the menu and daily specials to make sure we offer the most creative dishes around. Co-owner Marie Filbey hails from South Mississippi, bringing her love of her grandmother’s cooking and her hand-crafted cocktail experience to the table. With over a decade of combined experience in the service industry, Tyler and Marie have created an atmosphere that you’ll be craving for any occasion. We welcome you with open arms to “South-Bound.”
